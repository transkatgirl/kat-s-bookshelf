## Contents

Kat's Bookshelf is a small, hand-curated collection of courses which will slowly grow over time. The goal of the collection is to offer enough depth and breadth to be a useful starting point for further exploration.

Most content on the bookshelf is aimed at college & university level readers. However, courses covering relevant prerequisite knowledge are included whenever practical.

All courses included in the bookshelf are made using free, open-access books. Links to the original books(s) are included in each courseâ€™s description.

If you would like to suggest improvements to the collection (such as book recommendations), please [file an issue](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-bookshelf/issues).
