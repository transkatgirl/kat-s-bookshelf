## Contents

Kat's Bookshelf is a small, hand-curated collection of courses which will slowly grow over time. The goal of the collection is to offer enough depth and breadth to be a useful starting point for further exploration, while being entirely free to access.

Content on the bookshelf is aimed at a college-level audience. However, courses covering relevant prerequisite knowledge are included whenever practical.

All courses included in the bookshelf are made using free, open-access books. Links to the original books(s) are included in each courseâ€™s description.

If you would like to suggest improvements to the collection (such as book recommendations), please [file an issue](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-bookshelf/issues).

## Relevant Articles

The below articles have been picked by the bookshelf's creator to help provide some guidance to new autodidacts:

- [You Are NOT Lazy, You Just Lack a Habit](https://www.justinmath.com/you-are-not-lazy-you-just-lack-a-habit/)
- [Your Mathematical Potential Has a Limit, but itâ€™s Likely Higher Than You Think](https://www.justinmath.com/your-mathematical-potential-has-a-limit-but-its-likely-higher-than-you-think/)
- [Play the Long Game](https://theprogressplaybook.beehiiv.com/p/play-the-long-game)
  - "It is human nature to want immediate results. We are impatient creatures. When the snowball doesnâ€™t start rolling immediately, we give up. This is dangerous, because anything great in life takes time. Any outsized results is the culmination of extraordinary action for a long period of time. There is no hack. There is no magic."
- [Writing](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2015/03/14/writing/)

In addition, a study skills textbook is included within the bookshelf. Although this included textbook focuses primarily on education within existing educational institutions, most of the advice is still useful outside of that context.

- [Intelligence Killed Genius](https://guzey.com/intelligence-killed-genius/)
  - "The first requirement to do genius-level work is to not be afraid to do things only geniuses can do, i.e. to have the internal feeling of being better than everyone else in the world.
    The concept of intelligence kills this feeling. However smart you are, there is someone who is smarter than you. And if thereâ€™s someone smarter than you are, it doesnâ€™t make sense to work on the hardest possible problems and to try to change the world - itâ€™s the smartest personâ€™s job.
    You donâ€™t need need to be the smartest person in the world..."
  - "Genius is being extremely good at a couple of things that really matter.
    Genius is having a vision.
    Genius is not the highest g...
    Genius is like synesthesia. Itâ€™s the stray connections between parts of the brain that were not supposed to be connected that make your picture completely different, but might leave you just 2-4 sd to the right in g, orthogonal to intelligence.
    Genius is not being perfect, itâ€™s being unbalanced."
