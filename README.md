## Contents

Kat's Bookshelf aims to cover a wide range of subjects. Most subjects only have introductory courses, but some subjects with extensive real-world applications are covered in additional depth. The vast majority of content on the bookshelf covers academic subjects, but books covering non-academic subjects such as "Self-help" are be included as well.

Most content on the bookshelf is aimed at college & university level readers. However, courses covering prerequisite knowledge are included whenever possible.

All courses included in the bookshelf are made using free, open-access books. Links to the original books(s) are included in each courseâ€™s description.

This is not intended to be a comprehensive library of learning materials; It is a small, hand-curated collection which will slowly grow over time. However, if you would like to suggest improvements to the collection (such as book recommendations), please [file an issue](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-bookshelf/issues).

## Roadmap

This collection is a work in progress. The release roadmap is listed below:

- v0.x - Proof of Concept
	- The collection will start with an initial set of courses:
		- Introductory and (some) intermediate level mathematics courses
		- Introductory and (some) intermediate level natural sciences courses
		- Introductory-level social sciences courses
 		- Introductory-level humanities courses
		- 1 Self-improvement course
	- During this initial period, a focus will be put on primarily finding and fixing errors in existing courses rather than adding new ones.
		- Additional intermediate-level mathematics and natural sciences courses will be added during v0.x.
		- Some course textbooks may be replaced during v0.x.
	- Once all planned v0.x courses have been reviewed for errors, the bookshelf will move to v1.x.
- v1.x
	- The following additional courses will be added in v1.x releases:
		- Further in-depth mathematics courses
		- Further in-depth natural sciences courses
		- Additional breadth of natural sciences courses
 	  	- Additional introductory-level social sciences courses
		- Introductory-level business courses
		- Basic life-skills courses
		- Self-improvement courses
		- Additional textbook sources
	- Once all planned v1.x courses have been added, the focus will shift towards maintaining existing courses rather than adding new ones. New courses will focus primarily on increasing bookshelf depth rather than breadth.
