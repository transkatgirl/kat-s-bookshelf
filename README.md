# Kat's Bookshelf
A collection of [Portal](https://github.com/School-of-Life-Project/Portal-App) courses for ambitious adult learners.

> [!WARNING]
> This collection is an early work in progress. See the [roadmap](#roadmap) for additional information.

## Contents

The bookshelf aims to cover a wide range of subjects. Most subjects only have introductory courses, but some subjects with extensive real-world applications are covered in additional depth.

Most content on the bookshelf is aimed at college & university level readers. However, courses covering prerequisite knowledge are included whenever possible.

All courses included in the bookshelf are made using free, open-access textbooks. Links to the original textbook(s) are included in each course’s description.

This is not intended to be a comprehensive library of textbooks; It is a small, hand-curated collection which will slowly grow over time. However, if you would like to suggest improvements to the collection (such as textbook recommendations), please [file an issue](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-bookshelf/issues).

### Downloading

Due to GitHub’s limitations, only documentation is stored in the repository. The course collection itself can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-bookshelf/releases).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to download and import *all* zip files included in the release.

- [OpenStax](https://openstax.org)
- [LibreTexts Libraries](https://libretexts.org/platforms/libraries/)

## Roadmap

This collection is a work in progress. The release roadmap is listed below:

- v0.x - Proof of Concept
	- The collection will initially contain a small set of introductory-level mathematics courses.
	- During this initial period, a focus will be made on finding and fixing conversion errors in this small initial set of courses.
	- Once all courses in the initial set have been evaluated, the following additional courses will be added after completing evaluation:
		- Intermediate-level mathematics courses
		- Introductory and intermediate level natural sciences courses
		- Introductory-level social sciences courses
		- Introductory-level humanities courses
	- Once all planned v0.x introductory courses have been added, the bookshelf will move to v1.x
- v1.x - Building Upon The Foundation
	- The following additional courses will be added in the v1.x release:
		- Further in-depth mathematics courses
		- Further in-depth natural sciences courses
		- Introductory-level business courses
		- Basic life-skills courses
	- Once all planned v1.x introductory courses have been added, the bookshelf will move to v2.x
- v2.x - Further Expansion
	- During this period, a focus will be put on maintaining existing courses rather than adding new ones. New courses will focus primarily on increasing bookshelf depth rather than breadth.
